The AI Pet Robot is an interactive robotic pet designed with AI and machine learning capabilities. This project was developed as a final-year engineering project, focusing on computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. The system combines a Raspberry Pi for AI processing, an Arduino for motor control, and a remote server for running intensive ML models.
